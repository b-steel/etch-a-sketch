# etch-a-sketch

A simple Etch-A-Sketch program that "draws" along with the movements of the cursor.  There are three modes (normal, rainbow, and shading) as well as options to toggle the grid on and off and change the grid size.

I'd like to add a feature to allow drawing with the arrow keys in the future.
